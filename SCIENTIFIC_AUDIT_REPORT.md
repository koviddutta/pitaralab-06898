## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

### 1. Freezing Point Depression (FPDT)

**Formula Implementation** (Lines 196-206 in `calc.v2.ts`):
```typescript
FPDt = FPDse + FPDsa

Where:
FPDse = Leighton table lookup based on sucrose equivalents
FPDsa = (MSNF × 2.37) / water_content
```

**Scientific Basis**:
- **Leighton (1927)**: Industry-standard freezing point depression tables
- **Constant 2.37**: Based on molecular weight and concentration of milk salts
- **SE (Sucrose Equivalents)** calculation accounts for different sugars:
  - Sucrose: 1.0 (baseline)
  - Dextrose/Glucose: 1.9 (stronger freezing power)
  - Fructose: 1.9 (stronger freezing power)
  - Lactose: 0.545 (from MSNF)
  - Invert sugar: 1.9
  - Glucose syrup: DE-dependent (e.g., DE60 = 60% dextrose equivalent)

**Why It Matters**:
- FPDT determines **scoopability** (-2°C to -3.5°C optimal)
- Controls **frozen water %** at serving temperature
- Affects **texture** (too low = rock hard; too high = icy)

### 2. POD (Potere Dolcificante / Sweetening Power)

**Formula Implementation** (Lines 208-242 in `calc.v2.ts`):
```typescript
POD = Σ(sweetness_coefficient × sugar_mass) / total_sugars_mass

Coefficients:
- Sucrose: 100 (baseline sweetness)
- Dextrose: 70 (less sweet)
- Fructose: 120 (more sweet)
- Lactose: 16 (barely perceptible)
```

**Scientific Basis**:
- Normalized sweetness index per 100g total sugars
- Accounts for **perceived sweetness** vs **sugar content**
- Optimal POD range: **95-105** for balanced sweetness

**Why It Matters**:
- 10g dextrose ≠ 10g fructose in perceived sweetness
- Prevents "cloying" sweetness (high sucrose/fructose)
- Prevents "flat" taste (too much lactose/dextrose)

### 3. Composition Validation

**Optimal Ranges (calc.v2.ts lines 244-275)**:

#### Gelato (Italian Style)
- **Fat**: 6-9% (lower than ice cream for intense flavor)
- **MSNF**: 8-10% (milk solids non-fat)
- **Total Solids**: 36-42%
- **Sugars**: 16-22%
- **FPDT**: 2.2-2.8°C (softer texture)
- **Overrun**: 25-50% (denser than ice cream)

**Scientific Rationale**:
- Lower fat → more intense flavor perception
- Lower overrun → denser, creamier mouthfeel
- Higher serving temperature (-12°C vs -18°C for ice cream)

#### Kulfi (Indian Style)
- **Fat**: 6-9%
- **MSNF**: 12-16% (much higher - from milk reduction)
- **Total Solids**: 38-44%
- **Sugars**: 14-20%
- **FPDT**: 2.4-3.0°C
- **Overrun**: 0-15% (no churning, frozen solid)

**Scientific Rationale**:
- High MSNF from milk reduction (evaporation)
- No air incorporation (traditional method)
- Chewy, dense texture from high protein/lactose

#### Sorbet (Fruit-Based)
- **Fat**: 0-1% (practically fat-free)
- **MSNF**: 0-2%
- **Total Solids**: 28-35%
- **Sugars**: 22-30% (higher to compensate for no fat)
- **FPDT**: 2.8-3.5°C
- **Overrun**: 20-40%

**Scientific Rationale**:
- No dairy = no creaminess → need more sugar for texture
- Higher FPDT prevents icy texture
- Fruit acids affect freezing point

## 🤖 AI/ML Implementation Analysis

### 1. ML Feature Engineering (mlService.ts)

**14 Features Used for Prediction**:
```typescript
1. fat_pct                    // Creaminess, mouthfeel
2. msnf_pct                   // Body, protein structure
3. sugars_pct                 // Sweetness, freezing point
4. total_solids_pct           // Overall stability
5. fat_to_msnf_ratio          // Balance indicator
6. sugar_to_solids_ratio      // Sweetness intensity
7. PAC                        // Anti-freezing capacity
8. SP                         // Sweetening power
9. FPDT                       // Freezing point
10. frozen_water_pct          // Texture predictor
11. ingredient_count          // Complexity
12. ingredient_diversity      // Flavor balance
13. is_gelato                 // Product type flag
14. is_kulfi                  // Product type flag
15. is_sorbet                 // Product type flag
```

**Scientific Validity**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- All features have **direct physical/chemical impact** on final product
- **No redundant features** (each adds unique information)
- **Normalized ratios** capture balance (e.g., fat/MSNF = richness vs body)

### 2. ML Training Pipeline

**Data Source**: `recipe_outcomes` table
- User logs: success / needs_improvement / failed
- Actual texture achieved
- Recipe metrics at time of creation

**Training Process** (mlService.ts lines 129-217):
1. Fetch all successful recipes from database
2. Extract 14 features per recipe
3. Calculate optimal thresholds per product type
4. Generate feature importance scores
5. Save model to localStorage with version/timestamp

**Model Performance Tracking**:
- **Accuracy**: Based on threshold compliance
- **Confidence**: Calculated from feature deviation
- **Auto-retraining**: Every 5 minutes when 5+ new outcomes logged

**Scientific Validity**: ✅ GOOD
- Uses **real-world outcomes** (not synthetic data)
- **Continuous learning** from user feedback
- **Product-specific thresholds** (gelato ≠ kulfi)

### 3. Prediction Logic

**Rule-Based Fallback** (when no trained model):
```typescript
Target ranges by product type:
gelato: { sp: [12, 22], pac: [22, 28], fat: [4, 10], msnf: [6, 10] }
kulfi:  { sp: [14, 20], pac: [24, 30], fat: [6, 9],  msnf: [10, 14] }
sorbet: { sp: [20, 28], pac: [28, 33], fat: [0, 1],  msnf: [0, 2] }
```

**ML-Based Prediction** (when model trained):
- Uses learned thresholds from successful recipes
- Calculates deviation score for each feature
- Provides confidence level (0-1)
- Generates specific suggestions

**Scientific Validity**: ✅ EXCELLENT
- Fallback ensures system always works
- ML improves predictions over time
- Confidence scores indicate prediction reliability
