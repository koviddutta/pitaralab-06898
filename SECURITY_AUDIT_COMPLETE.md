# 🔒 Security Audit Complete - MeethaPitara Calculator

**Audit Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **All Critical Issues Resolved - Production Ready**

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive security review completed for the MeethaPitara gelato calculator application. All critical vulnerabilities have been identified and resolved. The application now implements industry-standard security practices with proper user data isolation, input validation, and clear authentication boundaries.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Implemented user ownership on all proprietary data tables
- ✅ Added input validation to prevent injection attacks and cost abuse
- ✅ Clarified authentication model (Public Calculator, Private Storage)
- ✅ Documented complete security architecture
- ✅ Achieved 100% RLS coverage on user data

---

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 🔴 Issue #1: Missing User Ownership in RLS Policies
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Any authenticated user could access ALL recipes/batches/pastes  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Solution Implemented:**
```sql
-- Added user_id to all user data tables
ALTER TABLE recipes ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE batches ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE pastes ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Replaced permissive policies with owner-scoped policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own recipes"
ON recipes FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ User A cannot view User B's recipes
- ✅ User A cannot modify User B's batches
- ✅ User A cannot delete User B's pastes
- ✅ Data isolated per user account

---

### 🔴 Issue #2: Missing Input Validation in Edge Functions
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Prompt injection, cost abuse, type errors  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added Zod validation schemas to `suggest-ingredient` function
- Validated array lengths (max 50 ingredients)
- Validated number ranges (positive amounts, max 10,000g)
- Validated enum values (product modes)
- Added clear error messages for validation failures

**Already Secure:**
- ✅ `paste-formulator` function has comprehensive validation (lines 44-83)
- ✅ Validates all string lengths and enum values
- ✅ Rejects invalid categories and modes

**Verification:**
- ✅ Rejects negative/zero amounts
- ✅ Rejects oversized arrays (>50 items)
- ✅ Rejects invalid product modes
- ✅ Logs validation errors for monitoring

---

### ⚠️ Issue #3: Authentication Model Ambiguity
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Architectural inconsistency  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Option A Selected

**Decision:** Public Calculator with Authenticated Storage

**Implementation:**
- Calculator remains free and public (no auth required)
- Ingredient library accessible to all users
- Authentication required only for:
  - Saving recipes to database
  - Batch tracking and QA logging
  - Creating custom pastes
  - AI optimization features (with rate limiting)

**Benefits:**
- Lower barrier to entry for new users
- Natural freemium model (try free, save paid)
- Security focused where it matters (proprietary recipes)
- Clear value proposition

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Complete architecture documented in `SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- ✅ Clear public/private layer boundaries defined
- ✅ Design decision explained with business rationale

```

### RLS Policy Pattern

**Applied to:** recipes, batches, pastes, recipe_versions

```sql
-- Each table follows this pattern:
1. user_id UUID column with DEFAULT auth.uid()
2. Foreign key to auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
3. NOT NULL constraint (enforces ownership)
4. Performance index on user_id
5. Four policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
6. All policies check: auth.uid() = user_id
```

---

## Security Controls Implemented

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Enabled on all user data tables
- ✅ Owner-based policies (auth.uid() checks)
- ✅ Automatic user_id assignment via DEFAULT
- ✅ CASCADE delete for account cleanup

### 2. Input Validation
- ✅ Zod schemas on all edge functions
- ✅ Type validation (strings, numbers, enums)
- ✅ Range validation (min/max values)
- ✅ Length limits (arrays, strings)
- ✅ Clear error messages returned to users

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- ✅ Session persistence with localStorage
- ✅ Auto token refresh enabled
- ✅ Auth required for data persistence
- ✅ Public access for calculator features

### 4. Rate Limiting
- ✅ AI suggestions: 5 requests per minute per user
- ✅ Logged to ai_usage_log table
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Prevents cost abuse

### 5. CORS Configuration
- ✅ Proper headers on all edge functions
- ✅ OPTIONS preflight handling
- ✅ Content-Type headers set correctly

### 6. Error Handling
- ✅ Generic error messages to clients
- ✅ Detailed errors logged server-side
- ✅ No sensitive data leakage
- ✅ No stack traces exposed

### 7. Environment Variables
- ✅ Service role key never exposed to client
- ✅ Publishable key correctly used in browser
- ✅ VITE_ prefix for client-side vars
- ✅ Secrets stored in Supabase vault

## Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Accepted Risks

**1. Calculator Results Visible in Client**
- **Risk:** Users can view calculation logic in browser
- **Mitigation:** By design - public calculator feature
- **Impact:** Low - core value is recipe storage, not calculator

**2. Ingredient Data is Public**
- **Risk:** Ingredient library accessible to all
- **Mitigation:** Intentional knowledge sharing model
- **Impact:** Low - benefits community, not proprietary

**3. Rate Limiting Based on user_id**
- **Risk:** Can be bypassed with multiple accounts
- **Mitigation:** Email verification + cost of signup
- **Impact:** Low - abuse would require significant effort

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] IP-based rate limiting for anonymous users
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations (recipe edits/deletes)
- [ ] Recipe sharing with explicit permissions
- [ ] Role-based access control for team accounts
- [ ] Export restrictions for premium recipes
- [ ] Two-factor authentication for high-value accounts
