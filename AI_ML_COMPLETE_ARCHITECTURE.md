# Complete ML Architecture for MeethaPitara Calculator

## 🎯 Overview

This is a **real machine learning system** that learns from user data, trains models, and continuously improves predictions. The system combines:

1. **Traditional ML** - Feature engineering, online learning, model training
2. **AI Integration** - Lovable AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) for complex reasoning
3. **Continuous Learning** - Feedback loops that improve predictions over time

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Data Collection Pipeline

**Tables**:
- `recipes` - User recipes with metrics
- `recipe_outcomes` - User feedback on recipe success
- `ai_usage_log` - AI API usage tracking
- `ai_suggestion_events` - Suggestion acceptance tracking

**Flow**:
```
User creates recipe → 
System calculates metrics → 
User makes batch → 
User logs outcome (success/fail) →
Data stored for training
```

### 2. Feature Engineering (`mlService.extractFeatures`)

Transforms raw recipes into ML features:

```typescript
{
  // Composition
  fat_pct, msnf_pct, sugars_pct, total_solids_pct,
  
  // Ratios (balance indicators)
  fat_to_msnf_ratio, sugar_to_solids_ratio,
  
  // Freezing characteristics
  pac, sp, fpdt, frozen_water_pct,
  
  // Complexity
  ingredient_count, ingredient_diversity,
  
  // Product type (one-hot encoding)
  is_gelato, is_kulfi, is_sorbet
}
```

### 3. Model Training (`mlService.trainModel`)

**Algorithm**: Online Learning with Statistical Thresholds

**Process**:
1. Export all recipes with outcomes
2. Filter successful recipes (user-marked)
3. Extract features from each recipe
4. Calculate feature statistics:
   - Mean and standard deviation per feature
   - Success thresholds: `[mean - 2σ, mean + 2σ]`
   - Feature importance: variance-based ranking
5. Save model weights to localStorage
6. Report accuracy

**Model Storage**:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "trained_at": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z",
  "accuracy": 0.85,
  "feature_importance": {
    "pac": 12.5,
    "sp": 10.2,
    "fat_pct": 8.7,
    ...
  },
  "success_thresholds": {
    "pac": { "min": 22, "max": 28 },
    "fat_pct": { "min": 6, "max": 10 },
    ...
  }
}
```

### 4. Prediction Engine (`mlService.predictSuccess`)

**Two-Stage System**:

**Stage 1 - ML Model** (if trained):
- Extracts features from new recipe
- Compares against learned success thresholds
- Calculates deviation score
- Generates suggestions
- Returns confidence score

**Stage 2 - Rule-Based** (fallback):
- Uses expert-defined target ranges
- Checks gelato/kulfi/sorbet standards
- Provides generic suggestions
- Lower confidence score

**Output**:
```typescript
{
  status: 'pass' | 'warn' | 'fail',
  score: 0-100,
  suggestions: string[],
  confidence: 0-1
}
```

### 5. AI Augmentation (Lovable AI)

**Edge Function**: `analyze-recipe`

**Purpose**: Deep analysis beyond rule-based predictions

**Capabilities**:
- Contextual warnings (ingredient interactions)
- Complex flavor pairing suggestions
- Natural language explanations
- Texture prediction reasoning

**Rate Limiting**: 20 requests/hour/user

### 6. Continuous Learning Loop

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Feature Extraction

**Why these features?**

- `fat_pct` - Primary texture determinant
- `msnf_pct` - Body and mouthfeel
- `sugars_pct` - Sweetness and freezing point
- `pac` (Freezing Point Depression) - Critical for scoopability
- `sp` (Sweetness Power) - Balanced sweetness
- `fpdt` (Freezing Point) - Temperature behavior
- `fat_to_msnf_ratio` - Balance indicator
- `sugar_to_solids_ratio` - Structural balance
- `ingredient_count` - Complexity measure
- `ingredient_diversity` - Variety indicator

### Training Algorithm

**Why online learning?**

1. **No backend processing needed** - Runs in browser
2. **Privacy-friendly** - User data stays local
3. **Incremental** - Learns from each new outcome
4. **Fast** - Instant training, no waiting
5. **Interpretable** - Clear threshold-based rules

**Statistical Approach**:
- Mean represents "ideal" value for successful recipes
- Standard deviation (σ) represents acceptable variance
- 2σ threshold captures ~95% of successful recipes
- Deviation from learned patterns = lower score

### Prediction Confidence

**How confidence is calculated**:

```typescript
// For each feature
deviation = |actual_value - learned_mean| / learned_range

// Average across all features
avg_deviation = sum(deviations) / feature_count

// Confidence (inverse of deviation)
confidence = 1 - avg_deviation
```

**Interpretation**:
- `confidence > 0.8` - High confidence, recipe very similar to training data
- `confidence 0.5-0.8` - Medium confidence, some differences
- `confidence < 0.5` - Low confidence, recipe is unusual
