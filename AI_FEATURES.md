# AI Features Documentation

## Overview

MeethaPitara Calculator includes comprehensive AI-powered features that help users create better recipes faster. All AI features use **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** through Lovable AI Gateway with no API key required.

## Available AI Features

### 1. AI Suggest Ingredient üéØ

**Purpose:** Get intelligent ingredient recommendations based on your current recipe context.

**How to Use:**
1. Build your recipe in the calculator
2. Click "AI Suggest Ingredient" button
3. Wait for AI analysis (2-5 seconds)
4. Review 3-5 contextualized suggestions
5. Click any suggestion to add it to your recipe

**What It Considers:**
- Current ingredient composition
- Product type (Ice Cream, Gelato, Sorbet)
- Target metrics (Fat, MSNF, Total Solids, etc.)
- Flavor compatibility
- Texture requirements
- Missing functional ingredients

**Example Suggestions:**
```
Suggestion: Milk Powder (MSNF)
Rationale: Your MSNF is at 7.2%, below the target of 9-12%. 
Adding milk powder will improve body and texture.
Recommended Amount: 20-30g
```

**Rate Limit:** 10 requests per hour per user

### 2. AI Optimize Recipe üöÄ

**Purpose:** Automatically improve recipe balance for better texture, flavor, and composition.

**How to Use:**
1. Create your recipe
2. Click "AI Optimize Recipe" button
3. Review before/after comparison
4. See specific improvements made
5. Apply or dismiss changes

**What It Optimizes:**
- Composition balance (Total Solids, Fat, MSNF)
- Sugar types and ratios
- Freezing point depression
- Ingredient proportions
- Flavor intensity
- Texture characteristics

**Optimization Goals:**
- Maintain recipe identity
- Stay within product-specific targets
- Improve texture metrics
- Balance sweetness
- Enhance mouthfeel

**Rate Limit:** 10 requests per hour per user

### 3. AI Explain Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Purpose:** Understand formulation warnings and get actionable fixes.

**How to Use:**
1. Look at warnings panel (shown when issues detected)
2. Click "?" button next to any warning
3. Read detailed explanation
4. Review recommended fixes
5. Apply suggestions to your recipe

**Warning Types Explained:**
- **Composition Issues**: Fat too low/high, MSNF imbalance
- **Texture Defects**: Iciness, chewiness, sandiness
- **Freezing Point**: FPDT outside target range
- **Processing Concerns**: Overrun issues, aging requirements
- **Flavor Problems**: Sweetness imbalance, off-flavors

**Example Explanation:**
```
Warning: Fat content too low (4.2%)

Why This Matters:
Low fat content can lead to icy texture and poor mouthfeel. 
Fat provides richness, creaminess, and helps incorporate air.

Recommended Fixes:
1. Add 30-40g cream (35% fat) to reach 6-8% fat
2. Consider adding 10-15g milk powder for body
3. Adjust water content to maintain total solids

Science Behind It:
Fat coats ice crystals, preventing them from clumping 
and creating a smooth texture. Target: 6-18% depending 
on product type.
```

**Rate Limit:** 10 requests per hour per user

```
AI Uses: 7/10 remaining
[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 70%
Resets in: 23 minutes
```

**States:**
- **Green (7-10 remaining)**: Normal usage
- **Yellow (4-6 remaining)**: Approaching limit
- **Orange (1-3 remaining)**: Near limit
- **Red (0 remaining)**: Limit reached, wait for reset

### Usage Logs

All AI requests are logged in `ai_usage_log` table:

**Tracked Information:**
- User ID
