## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.




**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables & Feature Flags

You can control major features via environment variables without code changes. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Feature Flags (set to "on" or "off")
VITE_FLAG_AI=on                    # Enable/disable AI features (suggestions, explanations)
VITE_FLAG_SCIENCE_PANEL=on         # Enable/disable science metrics visualization panel
VITE_FLAG_PRODUCTION_MODE=on       # Enable/disable production mode toggle

# Supabase Configuration (auto-configured via Lovable Cloud)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-key>
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
```

**Feature Flag Defaults**: All features default to "on" (enabled) if environment variables are not set.

**To disable a feature**: Set the corresponding flag to anything other than "on" (e.g., "off", "false", or omit it entirely):

```bash
# Disable AI features
VITE_FLAG_AI=off

# Disable science panel
VITE_FLAG_SCIENCE_PANEL=off

# Disable production mode
VITE_FLAG_PRODUCTION_MODE=off
```

After changing environment variables, restart the dev server for changes to take effect.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
