- AI predictions and insights
- All calculations and metrics
- Export functionality
- Local draft saving

**Limited Features (Requires Backend):**
- Saving recipes to account
- Loading saved recipes
- Accessing custom ingredient database

**What You'll See:**
If the backend is unavailable, you'll see a yellow warning banner:
> "‚ö†Ô∏è Using default ingredients - database connection unavailable. You can still use the AI Engine with the current recipe."

This is normal and doesn't affect core functionality.

## Tips for Best Results

### Recipe Optimization

1. **Start with a Template**
   - Use the default recipe as a base
   - Adjust gradually
   - Monitor metrics continuously

2. **Balance Key Parameters**
   - Total Solids: Controls texture
   - Fat: Affects mouthfeel and richness
   - Sugars: Impacts sweetness and freezing point
   - MSNF: Contributes to body

3. **Use AI Suggestions**
   - Pay attention to recommendations
   - AI knows product-specific best practices
   - Success score above 80% is excellent

4. **Test Incrementally**
   - Make small changes
   - Observe metric changes
   - Save successful versions

### Product-Specific Tips

**Ice Cream:**
- Higher fat content (14-18%)
- Total solids 36-40%
- More forgiving on sugar balance

**Gelato:**
- Lower fat (6-10%)
- Higher MSNF (10-12%)
- More precise sugar balance needed

**Sorbet:**
- No dairy (fat = 0%)
- Higher sugar content (20-24%)
- Focus on freezing point depression

## Troubleshooting

### AI Insights Not Showing

**Problem:** AI Insights panel shows "Add ingredients to get AI predictions"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have at least one ingredient with amount > 0
2. Check that ingredient amounts are reasonable (not all zeros)
3. Try modifying an ingredient amount to trigger recalculation

### Metrics Showing Red

**Problem:** Multiple metrics are outside target range

**Solution:**
1. Check AI recommendations in the insights panel
2. Focus on the most critical metrics first (Total Solids, Fat)
3. Use the Sugar Blend Optimizer to balance sweetness
4. Refer to product-specific guidelines above

### Can't Save Recipe

**Problem:** Save button is disabled

**Possible Causes:**
- Recipe name is empty ‚Üí Enter a name
- Not authenticated ‚Üí Log in from main page
