# RBAC & Security Enhancement - Implementation Report
**Date:** January 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

All four critical security fixes have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ 1. RBAC System for Ingredient Management
- Created `app_role` enum (admin, moderator, user)
- Created `user_roles` table with RLS protection
- Created `has_role()` security definer function (prevents RLS recursion)
- Updated ingredient policies: only admins can INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

### ✅ 2. Recipe Versions Ownership Protection  
- Added `user_id` column to `recipe_versions` table
- Backfilled from parent `recipes` table
- Updated RLS policies to validate `auth.uid() = user_id`
- Created index for query performance

### ✅ 3. Cost Data Protection via Public View
- Created `ingredients_public` view (excludes `cost_per_kg`)
- Set `security_invoker=on` to respect RLS policies
- Dropped public read policy on main `ingredients` table
- Unauthenticated users see public view; authenticated users see full table

### ✅ 4. Admin Panel for Ingredient Management
- New route: `/admin`
- Server-side admin role verification on page load
- Full CRUD interface for ingredients
- Table view with edit/delete actions

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Assign Your Admin Role

Find your user ID and assign yourself admin privileges:

```sql
-- Step 1: Find your user_id
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;

-- Step 2: Assign admin role (replace with your actual user_id)
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'admin')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

### 2. Access Admin Panel

Navigate to `/admin` in your application. You'll be automatically redirected if not authenticated or not admin.
